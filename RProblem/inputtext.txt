It is very important that multiplication in a product of several polynomial factors
be viewed as generating the collection of all formal products obtained by multiplying
together a term from each polynomial factor. If the ith polynomial factor contains ri
different terms and there are n factors, then there will be r1 ×r2 ×r3 ×···×rn different
formal products. For example, there will be 2n formal products in the expansion
of (1 + x)n.
In the expansion of (1 + x + x 2)
4, the set of all formal products will be sequences
of the form
